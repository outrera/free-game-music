[ FIXED ] popping / clicking noise at the end of the loop; files updated; ~ ~ theme for abandoned place, factory, chernobyl-esque, disaster, etc. ~ ~Loops seamlessly: Yes. Duration: 1:52 Sample Rate: 16-Bit Stereo, 44.1 kHz Included formats: WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC.  Tip: Keep in mind that MP3 is not good for loop/play mode (cus there's a gap/mp3bug between loops). Use wav, flac or ogg instead. ~ ~  Your feedback is highly appreciated!
