This is background music for a RPG or Adventure game. I tried to evoke an ancient evil being woken by some primitive ceremony. It has a flute/shakuchchi melody with some harp. It has a dark synth under current of background sounds. Before the repeat the synths explode in a noisy evil display, the evil has been awoken! Until the flute melody returns to bring some peace back.
