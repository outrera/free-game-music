This loop is some fake bit music that could be used for accompanying a scene of victory after a race or another kind of trail. It orients itself on older tracks from Virt and the Mariokart Ost for the SNES by Soyo Oka, while it uses more modern sounds.

If you need a longer loop or a version with loop and start cut in half, drop me a pm and i can send you something. If you're planning on using it in something, please leave me a comment. It's not a must, but i'm curious, where my stuff gets used :)
