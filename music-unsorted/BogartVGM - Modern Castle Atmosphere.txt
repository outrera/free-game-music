With this Track i tried to emulate the feel of the PSX days. I hope this Track is equal Parts chilling and exiting.

If you are intrested i could also craft a loopable version and export each section indivdualy so that you can make your own Version of the song or adept it to what is happening in the game. I have added the Midi of the Song also :) If you enojoy my music, please leave a like on my Facebook page:
