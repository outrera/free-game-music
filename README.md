A collection of incidental, transition and event music usable in games. So you won't have to scavenge the net in search of that fanfare sound for your RPG.

Everything is under royalty free license (mostly CC-BY, CC-BY-SA and GPL). See accompanying txt files.

In case you also need free to use game graphics, there is a separate repository to check out:
https://github.com/saniv/free-game-art

## Reason for this Repository to Exist
Some artists, like Ian Alex Mac, have pulled their CC-BY music out of free use. For example, https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Ian_Alex_Mac/Cues_Additional/ had a lot more tracks before. And many people at OGA have removed their songs or changed license to more restrictive. For example, http://web.archive.org/web/20150915182004/https://opengameart.org/content/mystical-enigmatic-background-music was CC-BY 3.0, but now it is CC-BY-SA 4.0, yet once give CC-BY license cannot be revoken. Other projects, like Monster RPG 2 are now under unspecified license, while earlier release had public domain license.

But the CC licenses have such property, that once granted, they can't be revoked. So I have shared the original files and license info, although I doubt the authors would be happy. So use at you own risk and be prepared to be called "asshole" and receive cease and desist orders, which you can legally ignore.

TLDR: OGA don't want to be the "place that holds people to their mistakes." I.e. if somebody has mistakenly released freely a music track, which got unusually popular, they may think it was a mistake to release it under CC BY and remove it from free use.
