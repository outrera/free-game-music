This is an orchestral album I composed a while ago for a non-existent RPG. It includes all the usual tracks you would expect with the genre - battle music (tracks 4, 8, 12, 16), victory fanfare (5), shop music (7, 13), and a bunch of pieces for different locations and events.

The tracks are in mp3 format, but I'm happy to provide lossless flacs if anyone needs it.

Feel free to use the music however you want, commercial or otherwise, as long as "SketchyLogic" is credited somewhere.
