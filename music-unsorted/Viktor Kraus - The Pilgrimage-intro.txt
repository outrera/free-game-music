This song could be used to introduce a character or a scene, that is calm, soft, yet powerful, since there are some heavy dynamic changes in the song. I started writing the melodies for something 16 bity and then recognized the potential it had for an orchestral track, so I did that instead! It's probably kind of a cross of Jeremy Soule and Yasunori Mitsuda.
