This was originally produced to back a poetry reading (the one with "do not go quietly into that night but rage...). 

I honestly think it works better for a horror game and since the poetry thing never came to light, I'm posting it here. 

It's dark, ambient, ominous and creepy. Best of all the synth being used is one of my own creation in Reason and it's utterly unique (and I can also produce more tracks with it, DM and I'll see what I can do).

Oh and you can find the Reason Combinator (Will's Spectre) here https://706gaming.org/instruments/reason-instruments
