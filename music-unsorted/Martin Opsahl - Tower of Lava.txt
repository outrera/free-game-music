This is an orchestrtal and cinematic piece. It has a lava-synth base througout and many changes with contrasting sections of industrial noises and orchesta. 

I'll cut this up for different purposes, as the orchestra track and the industrial/lava track can be used for different things. But this is the full on complete version of this track. 

The track has 4 sections. 
1: Tower of Lava 0:00-7:10
2: Magma Factory 7:10-12:30
3: Shrine to the Smoldering Volcano 12:30-18:45
4: Another Volcano 18:45-26:15

I had a classic RPG game in mind when making this.
